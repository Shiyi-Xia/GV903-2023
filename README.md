# GV903 Advanced Research Methods
Here are the course materials for 2022/2023 academic year, spring term.

At this term, we focus on more advanced models ubiquitous in political science based on maximum likelihood estimation and other estimation techniques, starting with the generalised linear model and its various outcome distributions (models for binary, ordered, categorical, count, and event history data) and ending with advanced topics like inferential network analysis and topics in causal inference.
